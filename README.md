# cannon-defense

Simple tower defense with levelup and skills logic. The game idea is to survive as many enemies as possible.

The game code is created based on:
- UnityEngine.Pool library for object pooling for enemies and cannonballs
- Zenject for factories, signals (global events) and dependency injection
- Quadtree structure for detecting collisions
